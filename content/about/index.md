##### About

I am a Senior Research Scientist at Adobe Research, working in the [Audio AI Lab](https://research.adobe.com/research/audio/). I received my PhD in 2019 at Northwestern University, advised by [Bryan Pardo](https://bryan-pardo.github.io/). Afterwards, I spent some time at [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) where I worked on audio [enhancement](https://www.descript.com/studio-sound) and [generation](https://www.descript.com/overdub "generation"). My recent work focuses on generative models for all types of audio, such as every-day sounds, music, and speech. I work at the intersection of computer audition, generative modeling, and interaction, with the goal of lowering the barrier to entry for content creation.

##### Contact & Internships

I'm always looking for bright and motivated students to intern with me at Adobe Research! If you think you'd be a good fit, please email me with your CV and research interests at pseeth \[at] adobe.com.
